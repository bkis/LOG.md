# LOG.md
A flat-file markdown blogging sytem so primitive it's a miracle it works

## Actually ...

## PAQs (Probably Asked Questions)
**Is LOG.md a static site generator?** No.  
**Could it be turned into one?** Yes. That would actually be a good idea, i think. A case for Future-Me.

## Attributions
LOG.md doesn't really do anything.
