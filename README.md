# LOG.md
A flat-file markdown blogging sytem so primitive it's a miracle it works

## Actually ...
... it doesn't even work at all, yet.

## PAQs (Probably Asked Questions)
**Is LOG.md a static site generator?** No.  
**Could it be turned into one?** Yes. That would actually be a good idea, i think. A case for Future-Me.

## Attributions
LOG.md doesn't really do anything.  
All the hard work is done by:
- **Parsedown** for Markdown parsing ([erusev/parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown))
- **github-markdown-css** for Markdown styling in default theme ([sindresorhus/github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css))
