# Does it make my code blocks pretty?
It does. Here, have some Java:

```java
System.out.println("Please, that's it?");
```

... or HTML or whatever:

```html
<h1>LOG.md is naive!</h1>
```

For real code highlighting, you'd have to use [GitHub's Markdown API](https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/).
